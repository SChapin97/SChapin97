### I am a backend software engineer that likes to focus on scripting and automation professionally and in my free time
---

### Employment Status
- I am currently employed by Thomson Reuters and work on a team that supports Westlaw - one of the largest legal databases and tools in the world.
- On this team, we scrape court websites and transform their content into an extensible and normalized format to be annotated, searched, or directly viewed by lawyers across the country.
---

### Development Background
- As a developer, I am highly experienced in (Linux) shell coding, Java, and Python.
- My main tools of the trade also include Linux system administration (one of my favorite hobbies), SQL DBMS management (Oracle SQL/PostgreSQL), RegEx (Regular Expression) wizardry, and Google dorking (advanced web searching) for debugging.

### Other topics of interest
- Outside of my main profession, I am also interested in cybersecurity and IT/Networking (I have a homeserver and am constantly playing with better ways to administrate my home network)

### (Public) projects that I am proud of

<img src="https://www.supremecourt.gov/favicon.ico"> [The Johnsonator](https://github.com/SChapin97/The-Johnsonator)
- This is a controversial project, however it best represents my abilities as a backend developer and a webscraper.
- Named after the Johnson Ammendment, this watchdog project was made in order to scrape 501(c)(3) websites to find examples of political speech that could jeopardize their tax relief status that their organizational status would provide.
- This project implements generic web scraping, audio transcription, SQL database managemnt, Python OOP code, and containerization usage (Docker PostgreSQL container)

<img src="https://www.redditstatic.com/desktop2x/img/favicon/favicon-16x16.png"> [Reddit Scraper](https://github.com/SChapin97/Reddit-Scraper)
- This is a set of scripts that will perform tasks like scraping a subreddit to watch for certain posts and to create a multi-reddit feed in html/email form.

<img src="https://open.spotifycdn.com/cdn/images/favicon16.1c487bff.png"> [Audio Multitool Project (AMP)](https://github.com/SChapin97/Audio_Multi-tool_Program)
- This is a project I orchestrated with 3 others during college. Its main purpose is to normalize the "loudness" (decibel level) of one or more audio files in order to make listening to a wide selection of music more seamless.
- I wrote all of the backend code, however the collaboration of the project is lost due to IDE and github issues the team faced during development.
- A partial version of the code with collaboration is found [here](https://github.com/SChapin97/Audio-Normalization-Project).

<img src="https://drafthouse.com/s/res/images/favicons/favicon-16x16.png"> [Alamo Drafthouse New Movies](https://github.com/SChapin97/alamo_drafthouse_new_movies)
- This is a script that will get a list of all movies currently showing or forecasted for the Woodbury, MN Alamo Drafthouse Theater
- I use this in conjunction with a previous text file to determine when new movies have been posted and send the output to myself for notification.
